# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun during the holiday season.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge will have its own directory, named `day_XX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`, etc.). Inside each directory, you will find:

- `ex_input.txt`: The example input data for the day's challenge.
- `input.txt`: The main input data for the day's challenge.
- `01.py` and `02.py`: My solution to the challenge, written in Python.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run the solutions, you will need Python installed on your machine. You can execute a solution by navigating to the corresponding day's directory and running the following command (where `filename` is the name of the solution file):

```sh
python filename.py
```
